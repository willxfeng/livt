module MuscleDescriptions
  ABDOMINALS =
  "This area is referred to a Rectus Abdominis and is more commonly seen as the six pack. The main purpose of this muscle group is to bend your body forwards, such as when performing crunches. There are 3 areas to this region, the lower, middle and upper sections. With a variety of exercises you are able to effectively concentrate on all areas for a overall development."

  OBLIQUES =
  "This area is composed of two areas, the external obliques as well as internal obliques. The muscles are responsible for the lateral flexion of the trunk, meaning basically to allow you bend your back to the side and allow your body to twist at the core. Toning these muscle groups will shrink your waistline as well as help with many sports and activities."

  BICEPS =
  "The biceps brachii are divided into two parts, the long head and the short head. The long head is on the outside and the short head is on this inside ~ closer to your body. The purpose of the biceps is to flex the forearm, flex the arm, and to supinate it.

  The biceps are a favorite muscle to train by everyone. They are a small muscle, therefore are easy to pump up and stimulate. Since the biceps are a relatively small muscle, they do not require too many sets or movements to be properly trained. The key is to use extremely strict form. Due to the use of curling the arms to train the biceps, there is an opportunity and luring temptation to swing the weight up with your body. A solid biceps routine should consist of both compound and isolation movements. Proper and full contraction-extension is the way to stimulate growth in the biceps."

  TRICEPS =
  "The triceps brachii are divided into three parts, the lateral head, long head and medial head. The lateral head between your biceps and triceps, the long head is on the back of your arm and the medial head is located at your lower triceps down to your elbow. The purpose of the triceps is to extend the forearm; the long head extends and adducts the arm.

  The triceps is a muscle which is usually neglected or trained in-effectively. Once again, the triceps are a bigger muscle than the biceps, but are still a small muscle so they should be trained with a less amount of sets compared to the larger muscles. As with biceps training, one should always add a compound movement along with an isolation movement. Close grip flat presses are great for building a foundation followed by and isolation movement such as triceps cable push downs which will hit all three heads."

  FOREARMS =
  "The forearm muscles are located between the wrist and elbow, the terms is used loosely to describe the entire appendage on the upper limb. Even though there are many muscles involved in the forearm area, the basics consist of two - the extensors and flexors. The first is responsible for the flexion and the later for extention movements of the wrist.

  The forearm muscles are usually rarely exercised on their own, which is not really an issue as most exercise that require some type of a grip always involve this muscle. Therefore, even though they may not be regularly exercised as part of a regular routine, they are a secondary muscle in many exercise. We do however recommend that some type of forearm exercise be included into your weight training plan as no muscle group should be neglected for a well rounded physique."

  ANTERIROR_DELTS =
  "The anterior group is the muscle responsible for abduction, flexion, internal rotations as well as transverse flexion. Basically, when you raise things to the front or push objects forward these muscles go to work. In other words, as with the entire deltoid muscle, the primary function is to move the arm away from the body, specifically to the front.

  The front shoulder muscle group is usually a secondary muscle group used for many exercises, especially those involved directly in the pectoralis region. Popular exercises such as shoulder presses or front raises are the most effective at toning and building this area."

  LATERAL_DELTS =
  "The lateral group, also commonly referred to as the side head of the shoulder muscle. Like the anterior, or front shoulder muscle, it originates from the collar bone and is attached to the humerus. This group is responsible for rowing movements and is effective in carrying heavy loads and lateral movements.

  The side shoulder muscle if developed and toned, can lead to the impression of a smaller waist as wider shoulders will give this illusion. Performing most types of side lateral raise exercise directly targets this muscle group."

  POSTERIOR_DELTS =
  "The posterior group, is also referred to as the rear head of the shoulder muscles. Unlike the lateral and anterior heads, the posterior delt originates from the scalpula and is attached to the humerus. The main function is to move the arm away from the body, specifically to the rear. In addition, it is also your primary shoulder hyperextensor.

  The rear deltoids are often a secondary muscle in many back exercises that involve the Teres Major and Rhomboid muscles. You can effectively target this group with direct exercises as well."

  LOWER_BACK =
  "Also referred as the extensor spinae and more commonly known as the lower back muscles. A combination of tendons and smaller muscles, it is not a single muscle on it's own, even though it is a large covered area of the back.

  Your lower back muscle region is a significant aspect of your core, which also includes your abdominal and oblique muscles. Having a strong lower back can have a significant improvement on lower back strength, pains and aches. Since you use your lower back on a daily basis, having strength in that muscle will great improve everyday tasks such as lifting or bending over."

  LATS =
  "The muscle is a large group found on your back and referred to by the Greeks as broad muscle of the back. It is a fairly flat, dorso-lateral muscle attached to the trunk that is partly covered by the trapezius muscles. It has many functions including those with your spine and shoulder as well. The main functions of the lats are to pull the arm down towards the pelvis, and in hanging positions to bring your body up towards your arms.

  The lats as they are commonly referred to as are the muscles that most people would assume make up your complete back. The areas that hang on either side of your body and are so pronounced in athletes. There are many exercises that target this group and in many different goals such as to add extra width or improve strength."

  TRAPS =
  "A long muscle, the trapezius has a trapezoid shape which runs from the base of your skull at your neck and down to your middle or lower back area. The trapezius muscle is quite unique as it muscle fibres have the ability to pull in three directions.

  Strong trapezius muscles are commonly seen on most athletes and are not usually considered a muscle to be focused on related to other groups for the average individual. However, it should be noted that trapezius perform many everyday functions and are a great benefit for everyone. Movements that involved moving your shoulder blades up or together as well as shrugging functions are all major functions."

  CALVES =
  "The calf muscle is divided into two general parts. One main part is the gastrocnemius, which is U-shaped. The function of this part is to raise your body in an upright position up by the toes. The other part is the soleus, which is below the gastrocnemius. It is used as well to raise your body, but in a position when your knees are bent.

  The calves are a very stubborn muscle to train. It is a fast twitch muscle which means that you have to train it with more intensity. You must fully stretch the calves at the bottom portion of the repetition and contract them in the full range of motion. It is recommended that you hold the contraction for a few seconds to really stimulate all of the calf muscle tissues. There will be a build up of lactic acid as you perform the repetition, however this is the point where you must do a few more reps to get results. Remember, train your calves like they are any other body part, do not put them aside."

  HAMSTRINGS =
  "The hamstring muscle is located directly at the back of your thigh and works in unison with your quadriceps as well as your glutes and calves. This promotes proper movement of the entire thigh muscles. It is actually composed of three posterior thigh muscles of the semitendinosus, semimembranosus and the biceps femoris.

  The hamstrings muscles play a large role in flexibility of the lower body. Most effective exercises generally are curls at the knee as well a dead-lift type movements. This large muscle group should not be neglected as it will improve mobility and long term flexibility."

  QUADS =
  "The quadriceps femoris muscle is composed of four prevailing muscles located at the front of the thigh. These four muscle regions are the Rectus femoris, Vastus lateralis, Vastus medialis and finally the Vastus intermedius. The strongest muscle in the body, the quadriceps is responsible for the extension of the knee.

  There are several leg exercise that successfully target the quads. The most effective of the bunch tend to be the leg press as well as the squat. One excellent isolation exercise is the leg extension."

  GLUTES =
  "Gluteus maximus, also commonly referred to as the glutes, this large and strong muscle group located on your buttocks is the most superficial of the group. It is responsible for many movements originating from the trunk as well as thigh movements.

  The glutes make up a large portion and therefore the overall shape of your backside. Many women as well as men aim to tone this muscle group for a thinner more appealing physique. Many thigh exercises will target the glutes such as lunges and squats. There are however many glute isolating exercises as well such as step-ups and hip extensions."

  PECS =
  "A thick and fan-shaped muscle, the pectoralis major is essentially the main component of a male chest and lies beneath the breast tissue in women. Below this muscle lies the pecoralis minor. Responsible for the movement of the shoulder joint primarily, the pectoralis major has four major actions.

  There is a large array of exercises available to focus on the pectoralis muscle including the four major regions of upper, lower, middle and outer. The most common are pressing exercises, flyes and dips. Some are more focused than others and provide different results such as thickening and strengthening the chest muscles or others such as shaping or adding striations."
